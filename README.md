# Crypto-Project for C++

Description: This program takes an average CSV file from a crypto exchange and calculates then displays information on a 8949 tax form. This program also gives some extra information that may be helpful for a schedule D tax form. 

-Classes were used by having the user display their personal information and salary and calculates the federal income tax for the person (locked into one specific tax bracket). 

-This program extensively used containers. There are many vectors, 1 array, 2 seperate structures, and 1 enumerated type which helped in a massive amount for user input where each number and length can vary wildly.

-Pointers were used in 2 functions (3 if counting the function parameters of the function that contains a function).

-There was a special algorithim made for sorting a vector into 2 vectors based on the dates bought and sold for crypto. If an item in a vector was calculated to be over 365 days then it was sorted into a vector, if it was under 365 days then it was sorted into another seperate vector.
